# Mean-Field-Analysis-of-Mutual-Insurance-Market
These are the codes for the paper ``Mean-Field-Analysis-of-Mutual-Insurance-Market''.

``main_non_constrained_ode.py'' is for the ODE explicit solution. Run this first to obtain a benchmark (a pickle file) for each single case.

``main_non_constrained_maketable.py'' is making the table for errors between the ODE explicit solution and the deep learning algorithm

``main_non_constrained.py'' is computing the single case under non-constrained settings

``main_constrained.py'' is computing the single case under constrained settings

``main_utility_non_constrained.py'' is computing the single case under non-constrained settings with utility objective

``main_utility_constrained.py'' is computing the single case under constrained settings with utility objective

``main_plot.py'' is for plotting figures.
